# Controller

The controller is tasked with overseeing the management of the volume for observability data across the processors and
collectors. It does this by analyzing the behavior of observability signals and correlating them with customer
requirements and the usage of signals in the system. Based on this analysis, the controller generates recommendations
and automatically updates configurations to manage and reduce the volume of observability data. 

## architecture

The controller architecture is described at [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)

## config
The controller can be configured to run with different stages and parameters.
See [docs/config.md](docs/config.md).
