# Config

Configuration of the pipeline stages is implemented via a yaml file.
The 'pipeline' section of the yaml file specifies the order in which to run the stages.
The 'parameters' section of the yaml file specifies the particular parameters for each of the stages.
Each stage has a name, and the names must match between the 'pipeline' and 'parameters' sections.

Standard field names for each stage are:
- name
- type (e.g. ingest, extract, insights)
- subtype (e.g. file ingest, promql ingest)
- input_data_types (list of lists)
- output_data_types (list of lists)
- config (configuration specific to this stage)

A sample config file might look like this:

```
pipeline:
- name: ingest_stage
- name: extract_stage
  follows: [ingest_stage]
- name: insights_stage
  follows: [extract_stage]
parameters:
- name: ingest_stage
  type: ingest
  subtype: file
  input_data: []
  output_data: [signals]
  config:
    file_name: <../some_file.json>
- name: extract_stage
  type: extract
  subtype: <some extract subtype>
  input_data: [signals]
  output_data: [extracted_signals]
  config:
- name: insights_stage
  type: insights
  subtype: <some insights subtype>
  input_data: [extracted_signals]
  output_data: [text_insights]
  config:
```

A stage may follow multiple other stages, and may receive input from multiple earlier stages.

## Map Reduce
A map_reduce stage takes some input, breaks it up into some number of pieces,
and then runs some computation (possibly in parallel) on each of the pieces.
The output of the `map` operation is a list of sublists.
Each sublist is provided to a different instance of the `compute`.
The `compute` part of a map_reduce stage takes a single sublist and outputs a single sublist.
The outputs of each of the computations are then collected by the `reduce` operation into a combined output.
The config of a map_reduce stage looks like the following:

```commandline
- name: parallel_extract_stage
  type: map_reduce
  input_data: [signals]
  output_data: [extracted_signals]
  config:
    map_function:
      name: map1
      type: map
      subtype: simple
      config:
        <any parameters needed to customize the map operation>
    compute_function:
      name: extract_in_parallel
      type: extract
      subtype: tsfel
      config:
        <any parameters needed to customize the compute operation>
    reduce_function:
      name: reduce1
      type: reduce
      subtype: simple
      config:
        <any parameters needed to customize the reduce operation>
```

All map_reduce `compute` operations are of the same structure.
A single list as input and a single list as output.
These must be preregistered in the code base as valid map_reduce `compute` operations
The `map` and `reduce` operations must likewise be preregistered in the code base as such operations.
