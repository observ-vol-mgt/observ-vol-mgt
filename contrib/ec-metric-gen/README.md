The generator can be used to generate fake metrics as well as custom  metrics with user provided labels names. 

## Fake Metrics
If the value of the metric name is not critical for the testing we can use the default mode to send the metrics.
```
python3 gen-metrics-gutentag.py --fake --nmetrics 100 --nlabels 10
```
You can vary the number of metrics and labels using the `--nmetrics` and `--nlabels` parameters respectively.

## With a conf file

```
python3 gen-metrics-gutentag.py --conf conf.yaml --nmetrics 100 --nlabels 10
```
The current conf supports certain set of metric type such as as can be seen in t
